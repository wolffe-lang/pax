# kernel/

The wolf kernel: first light (px01, M-PX1), physical frames (px02), paging (px03) and interrupts (kw10), on the wolf 0.2.23 release archive (px05). `kmain.lu` brings up COM1,
reads what Limine handed it and prints one line each — the banner, the
UART, the bootloader and base revision, the firmware, a memory-map
summary, the HHDM offset, the frame allocator's totals — switches to its own
paging structures (one `paging:` line), then prints `halt` and halts. `kmain_panic.lu` is a
second kernel whose overflow reaches the trap hook, which prints
`PANIC <kind> <file>:<line>` and halts. `kmain_frames.lu` exercises the
frame allocator; `kmain_double_free.lu` and `kmain_free_unusable.lu`
end in its named panics (`tests/mpx2-frames`); since px03 `kmain_frames`
runs its exercise on PAX's paging structures. `kmain_paging.lu` switches
and makes a map/unmap round trip; `kmain_text_write.lu` writes to its
own text after the switch, which must fault and, since kw10, panics
`page fault` with CR2 (`tests/mpx2-interrupts` I1). Since kw10 every
kernel loads its own GDT, TSS and IDT first (`interrupts.start()`), so
any exception panics by name; `kmain_int3.lu` takes a breakpoint and
goes on, `kmain_ud2.lu` panics `invalid opcode`, `kmain_double_fault.lu`
double-faults onto IST1, and `kmain_timer.lu` counts 20 PIT ticks
(`tests/mpx2-interrupts`).

| module | what |
|---|---|
| `serial/` | the 16550 driver on COM1: `init` (no interrupts, 115200 8N1, FIFOs; scratch and loopback checks), `put` (LSR-polled) |
| `log/` | a line writer over `serial`: `put`, `line`, `end` (CR LF), `put_byte`, `dec`, `hex`, all without allocation |
| `boot_info/` | Limine's responses (bootloader name and version, firmware type, memory map, HHDM, the image's physical base) read in wolf with `read_volatile` through `N as *T`; each request named with `extern "c" let` (kw10; `boot/limine.S` supplied the addresses before) |
| `frames/` | the physical page-frame allocator (px02): two bitmaps (free, ever-usable) over the memory map, its state in frames it takes for itself above 1 MiB, reached through the HHDM; `init`/`start`, `alloc` (row `out_of_memory`), `free` (named panics), the totals |
| `paging/` | x86-64 four-level paging (px03): `build` (a zeroed PML4; the image W^X per section from `boot/kernel.ld`'s bounds; the HHDM over usable, bootloader-reclaimable, ACPI and reserved-mapped memory, 2 MiB pages where they fit, without the image or the framebuffer), `switch_to` (EFER.NXE, CR0.WP and CR4.PGE checked, the stack mapped, MOV to CR3), `start` (both), `map`/`map_large`/`unmap` (INVLPG on the live structures)/`translate` (rows: `out_of_memory`, `misaligned`, `not_canonical`, `already_mapped`, `large_page`, `not_mapped`), `report` |
| `gdt/` | the kernel's GDT (null, kernel code 0x08 and data 0x10, user data 0x18 and code 0x20, the TSS at 0x28) and the 64-bit TSS with IST1 (a 16 KiB .bss stack), built in wolf in storage `boot/isr.S` reserves, loaded (LGDT, the segment reloads, LTR) (kw10) |
| `idt/` | 256 gates: 0-31 and 32-47 interrupt gates through `boot/isr.S`'s trampolines, #DF on IST1, the rest not present; LIDT (kw10) |
| `interrupts/` | `pax_interrupt`, the `export fn` every trampoline calls with its frame (`[abi.interrupt]`): a breakpoint prints and returns, vector 32 ticks the timer, a spurious 8259 request returns, every other vector panics `PANIC <name> vector <v> error … rip … rsp … frame …[ cr2 …]`; `start`/`report` for the tables (kw10) |
| `apic/` | the local APIC's page mapped uncached at PML4 slot 352 (`0xffffb00000000000`) and LINT0 set to ExtINT, unmasked: Limine leaves it masked, and an 8259 request would never arrive (kw10) |
| `timer/` | the 8259s remapped to 32/40 and masked; the PIT's channel 0 at divisor 11932 (99.998 Hz) with line 0 alone unmasked; `tick` (EOI), `ticks`, `wait` (STI; HLT; CLI), `spurious`, `stop` (kw10; the PIT argued against the local APIC timer in the module's header) |
| `panic/` | `wolf_trap`, the freestanding trap hook, in wolf; `fail(what, v)`, a fault the kernel detects, by name; `halt` |

- `wolf.pkg` lists `../boot/io.S` (port I/O, the halt),
  `../boot/cpu.S` (px03: CR0, CR3, CR4, EFER, INVLPG, CPUID's NX bit;
  kw10: CR2, IA32_APIC_BASE) and `../boot/isr.S` (kw10: the 48
  trampolines, the GDT/TSS/IDT/IST1 storage, LGDT/LTR/LIDT, STI-HLT-CLI)
  under `asm`: wolf
  assembles them for the kernel's target and refuses a call into anything
  off their roster (`[abi.asm.roster]`, E1306). The target is passed by
  `tools/build-kernel` (`--target x86_64-unknown-none`), not set here.
- Each kernel file is a standalone entry (`//! member: false`): a
  directory is one wolf module, and two `kmain`s would collide. The
  modules are child directories, imported by name (`use log`); imports
  are file-scoped and an unused one is an error (E0305), so a kernel
  names `panic` (for `panic.halt()`) even though the link would want
  only its `wolf_trap`.
- Limine's response pointers are bootloader-written, so every read of
  one is a `read_volatile` (KWC kw07, wolf-lang `eb955c3b`), afresh per
  call, through an address cast to a pointer (kw06). Limine's struct
  layouts are still read word by word at fixed offsets (`boot_info`;
  kw08's `offset_of` on `#[repr(c)]` mirrors is open to a later lane). A
  symbol's address (each request in `boot/start.S`, `boot/kernel.ld`'s
  bounds, `boot/isr.S`'s tables) is named with `extern "c" let` since
  kw10 (wolf-lang kw09); `boot/limine.S`, which returned those
  addresses while wolf could not spell them (wolf-lang#529), is
  retired.
- The frame allocator keeps its state in memory it owns (module state
  holds scalars only, `[mem.static.3]`), and that memory's HHDM address
  in a module `var`, read through one unsafe accessor (`st()`, px05;
  px02 and px03 threaded it through every call of `frames` and `paging`
  while wolf had no module state, wolf-lang#529). Its header is a
  `#[repr(c)] struct FrameState` whose fields are read and written as
  `u64`s at their `offset_of` (`[abi.layout.query]`), the bitmaps at
  `size_of(FrameState)`. `paging` asks `frames` for table frames and the
  HHDM offset and takes only the PML4's physical address.
- wolf has no bitwise complement (wolf-lang#575): alignment is written
  `x - x % PAGE`, masks spelled whole (`paging`'s `ADDR`, `ADDR_2M`).
- Constants are module `const`s in every module (px05 retired
  px01-px03's commented literals in `serial`, `frames` and `paging`;
  wolf 0.2.22 refused a module-level `const`, wolf-lang#560, closed by
  kw09). A `pub const` read from another module is still refused
  (wolf-lang#579), so `kernel/timer` exports its constants, and
  `kernel/paging` its flags, as functions.
- Module state: kw10's modules keep scalars in module `var`s (the tick
  and breakpoint counters, kw09); tables live in `.bss` that
  `boot/isr.S` reserves, because module state holds scalars only
  (`[mem.static.3]`). A handler resuming past a fault would write the
  frame's RIP through `f as *u64` at `offset_of(Frame, rip) / 8`: a
  store to a field of a raw element is refused (wolf-lang#577).
- `wolf.pin` names wolf: the 0.2.23 release archive by digest (px05;
  `tools/fetch-wolf` stages it and never builds; px02 and kw10 built
  wolf-lang `eb955c3b` and `6a4e6151` from source while no release
  carried kw06-kw09), and lupin's release and digest
  (`tools/fetch-lupin`; held at 0.1.44 for `tests/mkw` step 6's
  recorded refusal).

`tests/mpx2-frames` builds kmain and the three frames kernels on both
tiers, boots them under SeaBIOS and OVMF, and checks the totals against
the map, the exhaust, the touch, the reuse, the two named panics and
every halt. `tests/mpx1` builds kmain and kmain_panic on both tiers, boots them under SeaBIOS
and OVMF, asserts the transcript and the panic line, and proves each halt
through QEMU's monitor (`tools/qemu-halt`). M-KW's kernels (`KWC`,
`TRAP 1`) are frozen in `tests/mkw.d` and still booted by `tests/mkw`.
`docs/BOOT.md` says what the boot protocol asks of the object.
